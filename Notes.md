## Readability
 - The use of a switch statement improves clarity by explicitly defining behavior for each item type.
- Inline comments helps with understanding and readability 

##  Maintainability
 - The separation of logic for different item types allows for easier modifications in the future. 
- Constants (MAX_QUALITY and SULFURAS_QUALITY) help to make it easier to manage limits.

## Extendability
The structure allows for easy extension. For example, you can add additional case statements in the switch block if new item types are introduced.
The Conjured item type has been implemented as per the new requirement, showcasing how new features can be added without disrupting existing functionality.

## Testing
The code can be tested with unit tests for each item type's behavior. Each section of the switch statement could be independently tested, ensuring that changes to one item type do not inadvertently affect others.
