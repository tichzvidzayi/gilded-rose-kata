I approached the assessment guided by the SOLID principles to improve maintainability and extendability.


## Readability
 - The use of a switch statement improves clarity by explicitly defining behavior for each item type.
- Inline comments helps with understanding and readability 

##  Maintainability
 - The separation of logic for different item types allows for easier modifications in the future. 
- Constants (MAX_QUALITY and SULFURAS_QUALITY) help to make it easier to manage limits.

## Extendability
- The structure allows for easy extension. 


## Testing
The code can be tested with unit tests for each item type's behavior.
